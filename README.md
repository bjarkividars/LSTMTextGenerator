# LSTMTextGenerator

A text generator neural network I created for the final project in TÃ–L506M, Introduction to Deep learning @ The University of Iceland. The network generates a text example based on the beginning of the text. The network can also generate text based on some categories (In this case political party)

See a usage example in https://github.com/bjarkividars/LSTMTextGenerator/blob/master/word_lstm_notebook.ipynb
